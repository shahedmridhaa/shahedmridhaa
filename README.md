<p >
I am a full stack developer, and currently I am working with the MERN stack. I develop professional-level web applications using this stack. I use the MERN stack because it is currently one of the best full stacks available. I developed several projects using them. I have an interest in learning Redux, Next JS, mongoose and other frameworks like Angular and Vue.

I built also a couple of personal projects, available on my GitHub profile, and probably the list will grow in the future. I Love connecting with new people
